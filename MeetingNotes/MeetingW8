Meeting location: Microsoft Teams and in person
Meeting objective: Complete Iteration 2 function implementations plus tests


- Today we had an in-person meeting to discuss and look back on our Iter2 results and plan what we should do from now on to achieve the most marks.
We were missing some functions from Iter2 such as the dm functions, which needed to be done for Iter3, therefore, we allocated functions and tests to 
individuals in group and discussed the overall state of the project.


23/08/22:
- We continued working to finish functions and talked about the errors and ways to fix them on teams. The meeting ended with the members testing the newly 
implemented functions and making sure the tests pass locally.
