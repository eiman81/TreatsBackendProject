Meeting objective: Get updated with project progress + attempt at http tests

each test individually, however, they were not successful.

Meeting location: In person 
Meeting objective: Implement http tests for the basic v2 functions

- Today, we asked from our tutor about the way to impement http tests and he suggested that the most efficient way is just wrapping the functions in httpWrappers
which was good news as we didn't need to write individual tests one by one and it sped up our project timeline.

Meeting objective: Check in + implement http tests

- Throughout week 9, we implemented http wappers to test functions on server, there were some problems with server and some tests but they were solved. In this 
meeting we discussed that two people need to work on implementing some other functions and writing tests while two people need to continiously write the wrappers 
for these new functions and tests.
