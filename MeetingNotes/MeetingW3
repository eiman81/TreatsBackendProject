15/6/22:
- As most people preferred facebook messenger rather than Microsoft teams, we decided
to communicate mostly through facebook messenger. 
- If anyone had difficulty with issues, they should text the chat
- As a team, we went through the specifications of iteration 1 thoroughly in person.
Any confusion about specs, we asked our lab tutor and posted on the forum.

16/6/22:
- we started thinking and writing basic tests for our assigned functions.
- we discussed the best way to merge our code into master, which was:
    To merge to master the person doing the next round of functions will approve 
    the request.

- Also, throughout this iteration, we made sure everyone follows the format 
created in Week 2.
- We took close care in pulling from master everything we edit our branches so that
  the master doesn't get messy.
